## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[None]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[A challenge that I encountered was that I kept getting the logic for the guess function wrong, and the game would be lost or won, or the 
progress would increase when it shouldn't have been. I overcame this by tracing my input through the program, and following along with the 
code until I could identify what was wrong.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I wonder how web developers put their apps/websites on the internet, and how they implement more complicated features like 
logins, leaderboards, etc.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a little more time, I would add buttons to make it harder, all with different tones. I would also add different levels, where the user would
be able to play mulitple games and they would get harder as it went along, the sequences would be longer and they would all be generated randomly]
